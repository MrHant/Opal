Thanks for downloading Opal!

To install this application, please follow the following steps:

1. Download it! Which I assume you've already done....

2. Configure your database(s) in config/database.yml
   * Note: Opal requires a database to store image information in.
           Most ruby on rails applications use a database to store
           information. By default, Opal uses Mysql, but you can 
           use sqlite3 or any other rails-support database.

3. Type 'rake opal:install' while inside the opal directory.
   This will install the database structure of Opal. After Opal is 
   installed, it will ask you if you want to install sample data.
   This is good for first timers, but not required.

4. That's it! Run your application on the web using apache, mongrel,
   webrick, or nginx. The default Admin username/password is:

			admin/admin 

* Note: If you need any additional help, see the README section, it
tells you everything you need to get started, or contact us,
post in our forum, or check out the Opal Wiki at:
