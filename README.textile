h1. How To Install Opal

h2. Get Opal 

Opal is available at the following places:

 * "Official Website":http://www.hulihanapplications.com/projects/opal.
 * "Github":https://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal

If you have git installed on your server, you can install it directly from Github:
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal.git
</pre>

h2. Install Gems

Before Opal is up and running, we need to install all of its required gems(also known as dependencies). To do this, run this command:
<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

h2. Install Opal 

Next, Run the following command(while in the Opal directory) to install Opal's database schema in production mode: 
<pre>
rake opal:install RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>

This will install the database structure of Opal into the production database. If you leave out *RAILS_ENV=PRODUCTION*, everything will be installed into your development database instead. This command will also set up the default admin account, some sample items(you'll be asked if you want to install sample Data), and other stuff to help you get started with Opal.

  * If you want to automate an Opal installation, or if you just want to bypass prompts(that ask you if you want to install sample data and other stuff: run this command: _rake opal:install PROMPTS=FALSE_)

h2. That's it! 

You can now start Opal using the built-in Rails webserver, WEBrick... 
<pre>
rails s
</pre>

..or any of your favorite other webservers: apache, mongrel, nginx, etc.
 
* To log in to Opal for the first time, the default Admin username and password is: *admin*.

h1. Extra Stuff

h2. Email Settings

Opal includes an automated email system that will send you emails whenever someone registers, creates a new item, etc. 
To use this automated email system, you must configure the _config/email.yml_ file to connect to an SMTP email server. Here's an example of what this file should look like:

<pre>
development:
  :address: smtp.server.com
  :port: 25
  :authentication: plain
  :user_name: user
  :password: pass

production:
  :address: smtp.server.com
  :port: 25
  :authentication: plain
  :user_name: user
  :password: pass
 </pre>

h1. Troubleshooting

h2. Gem Problems

If Opal is having trouble loading any of its required gems, you can always store them locally inside of Opal. To do this, run the following command from the Opal directory:
<pre>
bundle install --deployment
</pre> 

This will store all required gems in vendor/bundle, which Bundler knows to look for automatically.
