h1. How To Install Opal

h2. Get Opal 

Opal is available at the following places:

* "Official Website":http://www.hulihanapplications.com/projects/opal
* "Github":https://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal

If you have git installed on your server, you can install it directly from Github:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal.git
</pre>

h2. Install Gems

Install all of Opal's required gems using bundler:

<pre>
cd Opal
bundle install 
</pre>

h2. Install Opal 

Next, Run the following command(while in the Opal directory) to install Opal's database schema in production mode: 

<pre>
rake opal:install RAILS_ENV=production LOCALE=en
</pre>

This command will install all of Opal's required gems(via bundler) and create the database structure of Opal inside the production database. If you leave out *RAILS_ENV=PRODUCTION*, everything will be installed into your development database instead. This command will also set up the default admin account, some sample items(you'll be asked if you want to install sample Data), and other stuff to help you get started with Opal. You can also specify the *LOCALE* parameter to install Opal in a language other than english. 
  * If you want to automate an Opal installation, or if you just want to bypass prompts(that ask you if you want to install sample data and other stuff: run this command: _rake opal:install PROMPTS=FALSE_)

h2. That's it! 

You can now start Opal using the built-in Rails webserver, WEBrick... 

<pre>
rails s -e production
</pre>

...or any of your other favorite webservers: apache, mongrel, nginx, etc.
 
* To log in to Opal for the first time, the default Admin username and password is: *admin*.

h1. Extra Stuff

h2. Email Settings

Opal includes an automated email system that will send you emails whenever someone registers, creates a new item, etc. 
To use this automated email system, you must configure the _config/email.yml_ file to connect to an SMTP email server. Here's an example of what this file should look like:

<pre>
development:
  :address: smtp.server.com
  :port: 25
  :authentication: plain
  :user_name: user
  :password: pass

production:
  :address: smtp.server.com
  :port: 25
  :authentication: plain
  :user_name: user
  :password: pass
</pre>

h2. Plugins & Themes

You can easily extend and customize Opal with new plugins and themes. Check out "Opal's Project Page":http://hulihanapplications.com/projects/opal#5 to learn more. 

h1. Troubleshooting

h2. rmagick

Opal the uses the rmagick gem to handle image uploads and special effects like color adjustments, watermarking, thumbnail generation, etc. This is the only required gem that is *native*. 

Since native gems often require existing compiled software, some people might have trouble installing rmagick on shared hosting servers. However, most hosting companies offer some version of rmagick. Opal works with many versions of rmagick, so if your server has a different version of rmagick installed, Opal can _probably_ use that one instead. Here's how: 

First, check your server's version of rmagick:

<pre>
gem list --local
</pre>

Then edit _Gemfile_, which is found in your Opal directory, and change this line:

<pre>
gem "rmagick"
</pre>

to something like this:

<pre>
gem "rmagick", "=2.13.0"
</pre>

Replace _2.13.0_ with your server's version of rmagick. That's it! Type in the command _bundle install_ and everything should install smoothly.  

h2. Gem Problems

If Opal is having trouble loading any of its required gems, you can always store them locally inside of Opal. To do this, run the following command from the Opal directory:

<pre>
bundle install --deployment
</pre> 

This will store all required gems in vendor/bundle, which Bundler knows to look for automatically. Bundling your gems locally is helpful when running Opal on shared hosting accounts, or when your user account uses different gems than the system.
