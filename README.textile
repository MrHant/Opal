h1. How To Install Opal

h2. Get Opal 

Opal is available at the following places:

* "Official Website":http://www.hulihanapplications.com/projects/opal
* "Github":https://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal

If you have git installed on your server, you can install it directly from Github. This is highly recommended and makes updating Opal a breeze.

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/hulihanapplications/Opal.git
</pre>

h2. Install Gems

Install all of Opal's required gems using bundler:

<pre>
cd Opal
bundle install 
</pre>

h2. Install Opal 

Next, Run the following command(while in the Opal directory) to install Opal's database schema in production mode: 

<pre>
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production LOCALE=en
bundle exec rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production LOCALE=en
</pre>

This command will install all of Opal's required gems(via bundler) and create the database structure of Opal inside the production database. If you leave out *RAILS_ENV=PRODUCTION*, everything will be installed into your development database instead. This command will also set up the default admin account, some sample items(you'll be asked if you want to install sample Data), and other stuff to help you get started with Opal. You can also specify the *LOCALE* parameter to install Opal in a language other than english. 
  * If you want to automate an Opal installation, or if you just want to bypass prompts(that ask you if you want to install sample data and other stuff: run this command: _rake opal:install PROMPTS=FALSE_)

h2. That's it! 

You can now start Opal using the built-in Rails webserver, WEBrick... 

<pre>
rails s -e production
</pre>

...or any of your other favorite webservers: apache, mongrel, nginx, etc.
 
* To log in to Opal for the first time, the default Admin username and password is: *admin*.

h1. Updating Opal

If you installed Opal with git, updating is a piece of cake. Go to your Opal directory and run these commands: 

<pre>
git pull origin master # pull the latest stable version of Opal
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>

That's it!

h1. Extra Stuff

h2. Email Settings

Opal includes an automated email system that will send you emails whenever someone registers, creates a new item, etc. 
To use this automated email system, you must configure the _config/email.yml_ file to connect to an SMTP email server. Here's an example of what this file should look like:

<pre>
development:
  :address: smtp.server.com
  :port: 25
  :authentication: plain
  :user_name: user
  :password: pass

production:
  :address: smtp.server.com
  :port: 25
  :authentication: plain
  :user_name: user
  :password: pass
</pre>
